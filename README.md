Python package bundler and minifier for the web

Pyodide-pack aims to reduce the size and load time of Python applications running in the browser using different strategies:
 - Minification of the source code via AST rewrite
 - Transformation of the source code into a different format such as Python bytecode (.pyc files)
 - Dead code elimination, by removing unused Python modules (detected at runtime)

Each of these approaches have different tradeoffs, and can be used separately or in combination.

## Install

Pyodide-pack requires Python 3.10+ and can be installed via pip:

```
pip install pyodide-pack
```

(optionally) For elimation of unused modules via runtime detection, run NodeJS  needs to be installed,
as well,

```bash
npm install pyodide@0.20.1-alpha.2
# A hack due to the npm package having issues
wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.20.0/full/packages.json -O node_modules/pyodide/packages.json
```

## Usage

For Python wheel minification via AST rewrites, run,
```
pyodide minify <path_to_dir_with_py_files>
```
